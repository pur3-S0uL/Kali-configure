Using Ansible to configure my `Kali Linux` to install and configure some tools.

It will install and configure the following Tools:
- GDB + Pwndbg
- Ghidra + Ropper + CheckSec
- Configuring Firebox + Burp
- VsCode

All thanks to [ippsec](https://www.youtube.com/@ippsec), whose vidoes I am following and got motivated to make my own Ansible Playbook.
