# Kali-configure

Using Ansible to configure my `Kali Linux` to install and configure some tools.

Currently it will install the following Tools:
- GDB + Pwndbg
- Ghidra
- Ropper
- CheckSec

More things planning to add like
- Configuring Firebox + Burp
- VsCodium
- Some other Visual tweaks

All thanks to [ippsec](https://www.youtube.com/@ippsec), whose vidoes I am following and got motivated to make my own Ansible Playbook.
